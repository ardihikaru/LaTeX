Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is a promising technology in terms of
spectrum utilization which have the capacity to utilize the unused
spectrum in the absence of licensed users. The communication within
Cognitive Radio Network is established by using Channel Hopping
Mechanism (CHM), which needs to be designed efficiently to achieve
better performance. In this thesis, four algorithms are designed to
minimize the percentage of Channel loading (CL), the value of
Maximum Time To Rendezvous (MTTR), Average Time To Rendezvous
(ATTR), Minimum Inter Rendezvous Interval (MIRI) by maximizing the
percentage of Channel Utilization (CU) in case of multi-users
multi-hops scenario. The performance evaluation of our proposed
protocols outperform in terms of Throughput, Average Time To
Rendezvous (ATTR) and Channel Utilization (CU).
