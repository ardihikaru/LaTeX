\section{Conclusions}
 In this thesis, four Algorithm of channel hopping
mechanisms are designed, such as Protocol 1, Protocol 2, Protocol 3
and MAA. Our works can achieves higher percentage of channel
utilization, Smaller value of MTTR, IRI, and ATTR with lower
percentage of channel loading.
\section{Future Directions}
Some feature directions of Channel Hopping in CRN are\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectrum sensing coexistence and sharing of multi-channel operations
    among SUs and PUs.
    \item Handle SUs mobility issues in CRN.
    \item Network Security.
    \item Increase degree of rendezvous specially in asymmetric
    asynchronous scenario.
    \item Establish a coordination among unauthorized SUs.
    \item Avoid the coexistence issue between PUs and SUs.
\end{itemize}
